<span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIPS:</span>
- you need to tell the "technical story" in a way that is captivating, but also respectful of the reader's time
- Executive Summary
	- the first paragraph of a news article: it tells a high level overview of the entire story
- High-Level Technical Summary
	- slightly more technical than the executive summary with a mention of each of the parts of the malware you've identified
	- diagrams and pictures help a lot, the example uses a diagram that mirrors the Graph view of **x64dbg**
	- <span style="color:blueviolet">don't forget to defang your URLs!</span>
		- like so: `hxxps://demowarecallback[.]local`
- Malware Composition
	- a description of each of the moving parts of the malware that were mentioned in the High-Level Technical Summary
	- include screenshots
- Basic Static, Basic Dynamic, Advanced Static, Advanced Dynamic Analysis
	- as technical as possible, plenty of screenshots, plenty of description
- Indicators of Compromise
	- screenshots of the indicators themselves
- Rules & Signatures
	- name all yara rules built for identification with a mention that the full set will be provided in Appendix A
	- information on specific signatures such as strings, URLs, etc.
- Appendices
	- Yara Rules: Copy snippets from VSCode, then right-click the location you'd like to paste in the Word document and select "Keep source formatting" to make it look pretty just like in VSCode
	- Callback URLs
	- Decompiled Code Snippets
