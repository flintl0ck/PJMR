- make a copy of the binary onto your desktop because these things tend to try and delete themselves during analysis

<span style="color:blueviolet;font-weight:bold">Questions</span>
**- What language is the binary written in?**
	- using `floss` we see "nim" friggin everywhere, so Nim
**- What is the architecture of this binary?**
	- using `peview` says "this version only shows a limited view of x64bit binaries"
	- use `pestudio` instead which has support for 64bit binaries
**- Under what conditions can you get the binary to delete itself?**
	- with `inetsim` running you can see the data exfil using `wireshark`.  if you disable `inetsim` and try to run the binary it will make a call to a domain (which will be unsuccessful) and then delete itself from disc
	- if the executable while it is running, it will delete itself from disc (this requires Advanced Dynamic Analysis.  Look for error handling that says to delete)
	- if an exception is ever hit or the executable finishes without an error code, it will delete itself from disc
**- Does the binary persist? If so, how?**
	- Use tools like `procmon`, filtering on the binary, to try and identify any host-based indicators that would indicate persistence
	- there are no persistence mechanism with this binary
**- What is the first callback domain?**
	- run `sudo wireshark` on your REMnux machine then run the binary
	- you'll see a GET / HTTP request with a domain: `update.ec12-4-109-278-3-ubuntu20-04.local`
	- this domain will not be found in the strings output for `floss` if you `grep` for it, but the exfil domain will be
**- Under what conditions can you get the binary to exfiltrate data?**
	- must successfully contact initial callback domain
**- What is the exfiltration domain?**
	- `http://cdn.altimiter.local`
**- How does exfiltration take place?**
	- binary sends `GET` requests to the exfil domain, but in the URL location is always `/feed?post=XXXXX` where the X's change every time
**- What URI is used to exfiltrate data?**
	- `http://cdn.altimiter.local/feed?post=XXXXX`
**- What type of data is exfiltrated (the file is cosmo.jpeg, but how exactly is the file's data transmitted?)**
	- we can reasonably hypothesize that this is data that has been copied from our system, encoded, and now shared with an external web server
**- What kind of encryption algorithm is in use?**
	- `floss` strings output mentions RC4 a few times (specifically the "toRC4" library load).  Could indicate encryption algorithm.
	- Open it up in `Cutter` and using the Quick Filter on the bottom left under the list of methods search for "toRC4" and the `toRC4` method will be filtered out, allowing you to open and inspect
	- video skips over how he knew to pull up the "stealStuff" method but that is the one that makes the toRC4 method call
**- What key is used to encrypt the data?**
	- moved backwards a bit back to Dynamic Analysis here:
	- using `procmon` and adding two filters
		- Process Name contains `unknown`
		- Operation is `CreateFile`
	- One of the processes creates C:\Users\Public\passwrd.txt which contains the string `SickoMode`
**- What is the significance of `houdini`?**
	- In Cutter, if you search "houdini" in the Quick Filter you will see a method called `houdini`
	- Now search "main" in the Quick Filter and select `NimMainModule`
		- search through the assembly graph and find the spot where `houdini` is called and it comes from a `jne` switch based on a call to `checkKillSwitchURL`, so if the kill switch URL cannot be contacted, we run houdini and jump to the end of the program
		- `houdini` is the method that deletes the malware off the disc and using the Graph view in Cutter you can see 3 times where `houdini` would run, answering the 3 conditions that would cause the binary to delete itself
