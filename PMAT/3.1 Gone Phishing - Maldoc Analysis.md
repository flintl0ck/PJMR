Analysis from the REMnux Box:
- xlsm files are actually more like zipped directories with different types of data files contained within
- `unzip filename.xlsm` to view contents
- `cat` the bin files, you probably won't find much but maybe a few clues as strings
- `oledump.py filename.xlsm`
	- will index the .bin files and identify the macro modules with a capital `M`
	- find the index of the module you want to inspect (such as `A3`) and use this new command to view that index
	- `oledump.py -s 3 filename.xlsm` the "3" is for the "A3" index.  This gives you the hexdump of the macro
	- Use `oledump.py -s 3 -S filename.xlsm` to isolate the "Strings".  Just like running `strings` or `floss` on a binary
	- Now try `oledump.py -s 3 --vbadecompresscorrupt filename.xlsm` and it may be able to recover the macro imbedded into the worksheet
