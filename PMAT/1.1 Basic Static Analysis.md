Basic - skin deep, preliminary observations used to build hypotheses for further investigation
Static - analysis conducted without detonating the binary

<span style="color:blueviolet;font-size:1.5em">Hashing a sample</span>
- SHA256
	- `sha256sum.exe Malware.Unknown.exe.malz`
- MD5
	- `md5sum.exe Malware.Unknown.exe.malz`


<span style="color:blueviolet;font-size:1.5em">Malware Repositories</span>
- VirusTotal

<span style="color:blueviolet;font-size:1.5em">String Identification</span>
- strings
	- `strings malware.Unknown.exe.malz`
- Floss
	- `floss malware.Unknown.exe.malz`
	- not everything will be useful but could be a quick and easy place to see hints at language used, functions called, or malicious URLs called

<span style="color:blueviolet;font-size:1.5em">PEview</span>
What does a portable executable actually look like?
	- an array of bytes
	- first byte (00000000) will be `MZ........`
- `[-] IMAGE_NT_HEADERS`
	`	- IMAGE_FILE_HEADER`
	- this will have `Time Date Stamp` which shows when it was compiled
	- the Borland Delphi timer will always show '1992'
- `IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER.text`
	- Virtual Size vs Size of Raw Data
	- if the Virtual Size is much larger than the Raw Data size then it could be a "packed binary" (there's more to this binary than what can be seen here)
- `[-] SECTION.rdata`
	`	- IMPORT Address Table`
	- view Windows APIs imported during the execution of the binary
	- API Calls to look for!
		- `ShellExecuteW`, `ShellExecuteA`, etc.
		- `URLDownloadToFile`
- MalAPI.io is a great WindowsAPI resource

<span style="color:blueviolet;font-size:1.5em">Packing Malware</span>
- Packing Programs
	- UPX

- Hints a program is packed
	- large difference in size between `Virtual Size` and `Raw Data`
	- signs of the packing program used, "UPX" found in the section names
	- smaller `IMPORT Address Table`
		- `LoadLibraryA` and `GetProcAddress` are API calls used to load other API libraries during runtime

<span style="color:blueviolet;font-size:1.5em">PEStudio</span>
- an all-in-one tool for Basic Static analysis
- SHA256 and MD5 hashes
- first bytes in hex and text (text will have the magic byte "M Z .. ..")
- will show binary architecture
- **indicators** -  *right at the top PEStudio provides a layer of analysis beyond just showing what's in the binary*
	- shows behaviors observed in the binary that could indicate malicious design and rates these behaviors (1-4) based on their likelihood of malice.
	- pivot from these indicators into the matching sections below to see more details on what has been flagged
- **libraries**
- **imports**
- **strings**

<span style="color:blueviolet;font-size:1.5em">CAPA</span>
https://github.com/mandiant/capa
- Capa is a program that detects malicious capabilities in suspicious programs by using a set of high-level, human readable, rules.
- Capa also has an open-source repo of rules that anyone can contribute to https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules
- `capa -h` for help menu
- run with `capa [path\to\malware]`
- **Malware Behavioral Catalog (MBC)**
	- https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown#malware-objective-descriptions
	- similar to MITRE ATT&CK but specifically for malware
	- will give an itemized overview of binary capabilities that are commonly seen in malware
- **Capability**
	- matches against the Capa rule set that is specifically designed for identifying malware capabilities
- *Expanded features
	- `-v` for verbose
	- `-vv` for very verbose
- Rules generation notes found here https://github.com/mandiant/capa-rules/blob/master/doc/format.md#yaml
