`yara64`
(the video uses `yara32` which has been deprecated and is no longer present on FLARE-VM)
- Yet Another Ridiculous Acronym
- install Yara support package in your VSCode
- Yara rules do pattern matching; strings, bytes, etc.
	- if you find an indicator that you trust will be common among all variants of a given malware, you can write a Yara rule to identify that indicator in other samples

Example:
```
rule Yara_Example {
    
    meta: 
        last_updated = "2021-10-15"
        author = "PMAT"
        description = "A sample Yara rule for PMAT"

    strings:
        // Fill out identifying strings and other criteria
        $string1 = "YOURETHEMANNOWDOG" ascii
        $string2 = "nim"
        $PE_magic_byte = "MZ"
        $sus_hex_string = { FF E4 ?? 00 FF }

    condition:
        // Fill out the conditions that must be met to identify the binary
        $PE_magic_byte at 0 and
        ($string1 and $string2) or
        
        $sus_hex_string
}
```

<span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP:</span> using hex dumper to view bytes we can see if the first byte is the typical "MZ" of a portable executable.  `xxd Malware.yara1.exe.malz | less`
<span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP2:</span> can use wildcard `??` bytes in the `strings:` section when identifying hex string indicators

Syntax: `yara64 [yara rule] [malware sample] [parameters]
Example: `yara64 C:\path_to_rule\yara_rule.yara C:\path_to_sample\Malware.yara1.exe.malz -w -p 32`
- `-w` suppresses warnings, making it easier to read
- `-p 32` specifies the # of threads for execution, 32 is the max
- `-s` strings output shows any strings matching and the location in the file where it matched
- pass `.` as the malware sample path for shorthand of "current working directory" and `yara32` will scan then entire directory you're in
	- you can also just pass it a full path to a directory and it will search the entire directory: `C:\Users\badassmalwareanalyst\Desktop` will search your entire desktop
- `-r` recursive search from any given directory.  you will likely need Administrator rights depending the directory you're searching
	- this will let you search through an entire filesystem for your yara rule if you're trying to identify additional artifacts
