PowerShell Script
- open in VSCode (change the file name to end with ".ps1" so VSC recognizes the file type, but this also arms the malware)
- malicious scripts will often be obfuscated to make them difficult for analysts to read, but in order to run properly they need to deobfuscate themselves
- this means we can replace portions of the script that execute the code with variable assignment
- `iEx()` is "InvokeExpression" in PowerShell, so everything within that is what is getting run
	- we take a look inside and see an object variable `nEW-ObJECt` is made and assigned a value that is a long base64 encoded string that gets decoded via `FROmbaSe64StRiNG` and then decompressed via `sYsTem.io.comprEsSIOn.CoMPReSsIONmOdE`

- <span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP:</span> don't forget to save an unedited copy of the malware for us to return to later
- in a PowerShell terminal, copy in the entire InvokeExpression function (including the base64 encoded bloc), then replace "`iEx(`" with "`$megasus =`" (and remove the trailing "`)`")
- you now have a variable that equals the true contents of the blob.  Print that shit
	- `write-host $megasus`
