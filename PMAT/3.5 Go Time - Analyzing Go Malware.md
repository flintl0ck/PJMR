Go can cross-compile with the same code base to all major operating system types: Win, Lin, and Mac.  This makes it quite attractive for malware developers

Instructor uses this analysis of GoLang when seen in the wild: https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/the-gopher-in-the-room-analysis-of-golang-malware-in-the-wild/

`floss Backdoor.srvupdat.exe.malz`
- GoLang binaries will contain a lot of indicator strings that should give it away immediately
	- `.symtab` section name
	- `Go build ID: XXX`
	- `golang.org` everywhere
	- `grep` for `-i go` and you'll get a ton of hits
- one key indicator for Go binaries is that they compile **VERY** large in comparison to the other malware binaries we've worked on here.  The one for this lab is 7mb which is literally a thousand times bigger than most of the other binaries we've worked on.

<span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP:</span> if the malware makes any http requests during execution, these can be easily viewed using WireShark and the HTTP User-Agent can be a very reliable indicator of the language used to write the binary.  I.e. `User-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1\r\n`

`PE-bear`
- because this is a 64-bit binary, `peview` won't work
- if you drop this executable into `PE-bear` you will see a "Sections" tab on the left-side menu where we can see the `.symtab` section, which is another indicator this binary was written in Go
