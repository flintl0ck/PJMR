The malware is just source code here, so open with VS Code:
- the code has a single class with an `updatejava()` function
- the first thing the function does is define a `byte[]` array, `rsrc`, with a bunch of hex values placed into the array.  Likely as an obfuscation mechanism
- inspect the API calls to see a pretty classic threat injection patter:
	- `.VirtualAlloc()`which takes a section of memory and allocates it to a particular size
	- then the program `.Copy()`s the bytes from `rsrc` to the memory address that has been allocated
	- it checks the memory protections on this section of memory using `.VirtualProtect()`, and changes them using `.VirtualFree()`
	- finally calls `.CreateThread()` to execute a thread that is pointing to the allocated memory space.  This effectively executes whatever is in the byte array, `rsrc`
	- the last API call, `.WaitForSingleObject()` puts the thread in a waiting state for an indefinite amount of time (`0xFFFFFFFF`), waiting for the `hThread` variable that was created with `.CreateThread()`
		- This last part is important because it puts the thread in a perpetual state of waiting, preventing it from ever showing up in the process list as it remains waiting for the handle to the thread.  memory injection

- deobfuscate the `rsrc` array
	- in C# syntax `0x` denotes that it is a hexadecimal byte and the following 2 characters are the byte
	- instructor uses python to parse just the hex bytes out
		- `hex_string = f.read().replace("0x","")
		- removes everything but the hex data
		- **TIP:** the instructor uses 2 additional `.replace()` calls to remove the text leading up to the "{" and then the text after the "}".  This is ridiculous, just copy/paste the actual array data out.  Should look like "`0xfc,0xe8...0x00`"
	- instructor sends hex output to `out.bin` and transfers to Flare-VM, but just copy/paste
	- use the shellcode debugger to figure out what this is
		- `scdbg /f <filename> -s -1`
			- `/f` tells it you're giving it a file
			- `-s` is the "steps" parameter and the `-1` value sets it to "unlimited", so it shows all shellcode steps
		- ![[Pasted image 20231125133706.png]]
		- loads the `wininet` library then makes a bunch of pretty self explanatory API calls:
		- connects to a server over HTTPS (443), downloads a file as `javaupdate.exe`, then executes it

Extracting shellcode from the memory of a running process
- drop the executable into pestudio, open the "imports" section, and filter to the flagged imports
- ![[Pasted image 20231125134813.png]]
- `WriteProcessMemory`,`CreateRemoteThread`,`OpenProcess`, and `VirtualProtect` should all stand out to you as indicators that this might be remote thread injection

- open in Cutter
	- notice there are no debug symbols here.  We on hard mode now
	- the decompiler will automatically identify the entry point (`entry0()`), but for this exercise start at the end of the program and work backwards to find the last place where a function returned something into the `eax` register
	- this allows us to find the `main()` function as the last thing that happens when a binary is executed is the `main()` function returns a value into CRT (the C Runtime)
	- double click the last `call` in the entry point and it will open up a big graph.  Much of this will be boilerplate for properly setting up a CRT, so scroll to the end where the main function will be located
	- the very bottom of the graph shows `dword` gets moved into `eax`
	- <span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP:</span> click on the memory value of the `dword` value and Cutter will highlight that same value everywhere else in the graph
	- <span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP2:</span> because this call returns a value into `eax` and then later that value of `eax` is later returned to the operating system after the program is done, we can reasonably assume that this is the `main()` function
		- double click the `call` to the main function to inspect further
	- <span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP3:</span> rename the function to "main" to make it easier for us to find in the future.  Right-click > Edit function

	- There are 3 call functions within `Main` so start with the bottom and work your way up.  The bottom call has all of the indicators (API calls) of a classic remote thread injection that we saw earlier: `WriteProcessMemory`,`CreateRemoteThread`,`OpenProcess`, and `VirtualProtect`
	- Grab the memory location for `WriteProcessMemory`and open up x64dbg

- x64dbg
	- open the executable
	- from the main `CPU` tab press Ctrl+G, which will allow you to search for a memory location
	- Paste the location of `WriteProcessMemory` we got from Cutter
- Check the Microsoft documentation for this API call: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory
	- the `lpBuffer` parameter contains the data to be written in the address space of the specified process
	- basically this is the parameter malware will leverage to inject the "bad stuff" during a Create Remote Thread injection
- back to x64dbg
	- the third parameter (which is `lpBuffer`) is the buffer for the malicious bytes.  Count back from the API call 3 lines to see what value is moved to where
	- in this instance the `rcx` value is moved into the `r8` register (the `r8` register is used for a parameter pass in x64 architecture)
	- right-click on the `mov r8,rcx` and select "Follow in Dump" to view what is currently held in the `r8` register
		- <span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP:</span> this will only work if you've set the proper break point on the `WriteProcessMemory` API call and then F8'd the debugger to that location in the program.  This causes the program to run up until that point (including moving the `rcx` value to the `r8` register), where we can now view it
	- check the Hex section of the "Dump 1" to view the values placed into the `r8` register
	- to view these more clearly, highlight everything in that dump, right-click, go to Binary, then click "Save to a File".  Save it to the desktop for viewing the shellcode bytes
	- Just use `scdbg` like we did earlier
