Debugger - grants control over every function that is executed

Disassembling & Decompiling (`Dropper.DownloadFromURL.exe.malz`):
- Cutter
	- `Select` and select malware file, then `Open`
	- Leave `Analysis: Enabled` and `Level: Auto-Analysis (aaa)`
	- Useful Windows to have open: 
		- Dashboard, Strings, Imports, Search, Disassembly, Graph(main), Hexdump, Decompiler
	- Open `Disassembly` tab on bottom of screen and navigate to the `main` function
		- `push str` writes something to a file and will show the name of the file, the location, and possible clues like a URL
	- `Graph (main)` gives a visual representation of how the binary will migrate from function to function based on certain parameters
		- `jne 0x401142` "jump if not equal" - will have two lines extending out of the bottom of the function.  Will jump to the designated path if `test` values are not equal, otherwise continues as normal
	- `Decompiler` takes the assembly and attempts to recreate the original source code as close as possible

x86 Architecture:
- CPU Instructions
	- Arithmetic instructions like `sub`
	- Data movement instructions like `mov`
	- Control flow instruction like `jmp`
	- x86 is little endian (reads right to left)
		- Syntax like - `instruction` `source` `destination` 
		- `jnz 0x012300` - "jump if not zero" and then provides destination
	- `push` and `pop` are how you interact with the Stack
	- `call` allows you to call another function.  Any variable passed with the call function is added to the Stack
- Memory Registers
	- `eax` accumulator register
	- `edx` data register
	- `ebx` base register
	- `esp` extended stack pointer
	- `ebp` extended base pointer
	- `eip` extended instruction pointer
- Stack
	- "the Stack grows downwards" which means as things are added with `push` to the Stack they are added to the bottom
	- `pop` removes the lowest item on the Stack which is the most recently added item

- How it works:
	- `main` method follows given instructions until a `call` is made to another function, which pauses the main method and moves to the top of the called function
	- if another `call` is made during the called function, the location in the first function is saved in the `ebp` (extended base pointer) so that we can return to that exact spot after completing the second called function
	- `ret` returns to the spot of the previous function listed in the `ebp`.  This eventually takes you back to `main` to finish the function

Hello World (`helloWorld.exe`)
 - Cutter
	 - Basic info: 32 bit, x86 architecture, C lang
	 - Libraries: quick view of libraries called by binary
	 - Functions windows (left side)
		 - dbg functions (dbx.WinMainCRTStartup) visible, meaning this binary has not been stripped of its debug symbols
		 - malware authors will typically strip these out using a strip utility, making it harder to understand
	- `Imports` tab shows a complete list of API calls from one of the other libraries loaded
	- `Strings` tab shows identified strings and will show the Address (location in memory) and Section will show the section the string was found (".rdata")
		- the `rdata` section is used to hold Read Only data, so if a static string is known by the compiler and does not change throughout the program execution, it will likely end up in the `rdata` section
		- Right-click an interesting string and select "Show in >"
		- `Disassembly` using the memory off-set location found in Address, locate the string
			- Use the search bar at the top to paste in the Address for a quick jump to location
		- Show in > `Hexdump` to jump to the location of the string in the Hexdump tab.  These bytes can be changed to change how the binary works
