Extract the malware samples into /.../blue-jupyter/malware-analysis/dropbox

The blue-jupyter notebook is setup to automate the analysis of malware samples:
- Enumerate Samples
- Create a Saved Specimen Directory (dir names include time stamp)
- Defand Samples
- File Hashes
- String Analysis
	- uses `StringSifter` that uses ML model to rank binary strings by relevance
- VT Analysis
	- will require a free public API key
	- the HuskyHacks fork of the original blue-jupyter repo includes a `sleep(16)` in the VT API sample submission section that allows us to go past the 4 sample limit
	- this will take some time before the `Criticality Level: ` propagates

<span style="color:blueviolet;font-weight:bold">Any.Run Interaction Malware Sandbox</span>
- https://app.any.run
- very straight forward - click "+ New task" and upload the sample
	- turn on "Pro mode" to get more fine tuning and customization like FakeNet

<span style="color:blueviolet;font-weight:bold">ChatGPT</span>
- frame your session in a legal and ethical connotation so that ChatGPT doesn't report you for malware dev
- ask chatgpt to "pretty print" obfuscated code, and add comments explaining what each section does
- <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">CROWDSTRIKE CAUTION:</span> if you are conducting analysis on malware samples collected from Falcon Complete customers, please **DO NOT** submit anything related to your analysis into ChatGPT.  The is explicitly against protocol and could potentially put sensitive customer data or proprietary CrowdStrike data at risk of exposure.  To reiterate: only use ChatGPT for malware analysis done on your personal time and never submit anything related to work done as a CrowdStrike employee!
- <span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">Ez ChatGPT Script Analysis Prompt:</span>
	- Analyze the following script, pretty print and rename variables to be more readable and add comments explaining what is going on: `script`
