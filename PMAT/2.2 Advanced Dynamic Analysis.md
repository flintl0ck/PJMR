	(has dark mode)
- debugger gives you complete control of each section of the binary as it executes
- assembly level
- CPU Tab
	- looks like disassembled output from cutter
	- the assembly instructions that will execute
- Right side of the screen are the memory registers
	- shows a reading of the program's memory locations at any given point during execution
	- EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EBP, ESP, ESI, EDI, EIP (extended instruction pointer)
		- EIP - the memory instruction of whatever is going to execute next in the debugger
- F2 - Insert Breakpoint
	- click the Breakpoints tab to see all breakpoints in the program
- F7 - step into (if there's a `call` you step into it and go to the beginning of the call location)
- F8 - step over (if there's a `call` you skip it and the debugger moves to the next step as if the call already happened)
- F9 - Run
- Open the Debug menu drop down to see all F key commands
- Click restart on the top left to return to the top of the program (you can't go backwards)

<span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP:</span> once you restart the program, press F9 to go to the `entrypoint` but press F9 again to execute the entire program (which will show as `Terminated Debugging stopped!` on the bottom left)

<span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP2:</span> restart the program, press F9 for the `entrypoint`, then start pressing F8 until the debugger hangs.  This is an indication that a function was called and the program did something
 - press F2 to set a break point at this spot
 - right-click the function call and select "Follow in Disassembler"

<span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP3:</span> if you know the binary will try to download from the internet, spin up wireshark and intercept the request

<span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP4:</span> set a breakpoint at the beginning of the `main` function and at the first call in the `main` function

<span style="color:blueviolet;font-weight:bold">HelloWorld under a microscope</span>
- start in Cutter to find the point in memory where `main` function starts
	- grab the memory location (should look like 0x00401530)
- open the same binary in x32dbg then Ctrl+G and paste the memory location into the pop-up
- pay attention to when things are in hex vs dec
- when the program is pushing/calling to/from memory, right click the location name in the right have window (such as "ESP") and select `Follow in Dump` then click the name of the value being pointed to by ESP
	- This will open the Dump in the bottom left window and show you the Hex and ASCII value.  You now have a chance to change these bytes before they are executed
	- ![[Pasted image 20231114132440.png]]
	- highlight what you want to change, right-click, Binary, Edit.  Make changes, click OK
	- alternatively you can click "Fill..." instead of Edit and fill the null bytes with whatever you choose.  `90` is the Hex value for "No Operation", call a nop byte
