Malware may be designed to avoid analysis in many ways.  Typically there is a check put in place that if it fails, the malware deletes itself from the disc.  These checks could be:
- check the SHA256 of downloaded payload to see if it matches correct malware hash
- attempt to connect to specific web address
- if the program is interrupted or fails to execute
- if the program executes successfully
- if AV is detected on the machine

How to:
Open in Cutter, then open the `main()` module in the Decompiler panel
	<span style="color:yellow;font-weight:bold">TIP:</span> Nim (or other lang) compiled programs will have a few wrapper functions around the true `main()` function, so you may need to drill down a few levels.  Cutter will typically identify `main()` for you.
	For a Nim program it will be called `_NimMain()`, but you'll have to dig deeper into that to find `_NimMainInner` and then finally `NimMainModule()`

Once you find the main module and are pulling apart the inner functions, use Graph mode to better view their relationships

`jne` or "jump if not equal" will split the paths of the program based upon the outcome of previous instruction.  In this instance `test al al`

`test` is the "Binary AND" operator, so `al` AND `al`, and then sets that value to the Zero Flag (which can be set to either 1 or 0)
**If the Zero Flag is equal to 0, the JNE instruction will be taken. If the Zero flag is equal to 1, the JNE instruction will not be taken.** When you see the program splitting to one path or the other because of a JNE instruction, it’s going one way or the other way depending on if the Zero Flag is set (equal to zero).

<span style="color:limegreen;font-weight:bold">XOR</span> is "Exclusive or" and is a comparative operator that outputs a boolean value.  If the two variables are the same, it outputs "False", and only "True" if they are different.
0, 0 = False
0, 1 = True
1, 0 = True
1, 1 = False

**The Patch**
The opposite of `jne` is `je`, or Jump if Equal To.  This does the exact opposite of `jne`: if the Zero Flag is set to 1, the jump will be taken.
Right click > Edit > Reverse Jump

**IsDebuggerPresent()**
Very simply concept.  Checks if a debugger is present while running the program.  Easy to avoid, you can switch the `je` or `jne` jump OR you can just change the value of the Zero Flag it's looking at
