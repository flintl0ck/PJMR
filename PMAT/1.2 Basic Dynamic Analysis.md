Dynamic - actually running the binary being run.  Also know as *heuristic* or *behavioral*
Indicators
	- Host indicators occur directly on the host (files created/deleted, dlls run)
	- Network indicators occur over the network (DNS requests, downloads from URL)

Initiate all tools:
- run `inetsim` on Remnux box (configured as network DNS)
	- navigate to any website.com/file.exe from the browser and inetsim will serve a default binary
- run `sudo wireshark` on Remnux box 
	- <span style="font-size:.7em">(PMAT runs it on Remnux but could benefit from being run directly on host)</span>

Use existing clues to hone your search:
- domains identified in Basic Static Analysis can be used as search keys in Wireshark
	- `http.request.full_uri contains <domain.clue>`
- take screenshots of the captured network indicators in wireshark
